# 🏠 House Price Prediction

This project focuses on predicting house prices using machine learning algorithms. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, and evaluation. The implementation is done in Python using libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn within a Jupyter Notebook environment.

## 📂 Project Structure

- `house_price_prediction.ipynb` – The main Jupyter notebook with complete implementation from data loading to model evaluation.

## 🔍 Features

- Data cleaning and missing value handling
- Feature engineering and encoding
- Exploratory data visualization
- Regression model training (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees)
- Performance evaluation using metrics such as R² Score and RMSE

## 🛠️ Requirements

Make sure you have the following libraries installed:
```bash
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
````

You can install them using:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the notebook.
2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
3. Open `house_price_prediction.ipynb` and run all the cells step by step.

## 📈 Model Performance

The model's performance is evaluated using regression metrics such as:

* Mean Squared Error (MSE)
* Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
* R² Score

## 🎯 Objective

The goal is to build a predictive model that estimates house prices based on features such as location, size, number of bedrooms, etc., which can help both buyers and real estate analysts make informed decisions.
